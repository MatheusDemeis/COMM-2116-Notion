3. Choose "Heading 1" from the menu
4. Type "Spring 2025" (or your current semester)
   ![Screenshow showing the finished semester section](assets/images/semester-section-done.png)
   it should look like this when you're done

## Creating Class Pages

For each class you're taking:

1. Click the "+" button under your semester heading, just like how you created the heading 1 tag
2. Select "Page" from the menu
   ![screenshot showing how to create a subpage](assets/images/create-subpage.png)
3. Type your class name (Example: "MATH 101")
4. Click "Add icon" to add an emoji to help you better categorize the class
    - Try ðŸ“š for English
    - Or ðŸ”¢ for Math
    - Or ðŸ§ª for Science
      ![screenshot showing how you can add an icon to a page for better organization](assets/images/add-icon.png)
5. Now you've successfully made a subpage in your notion project!
   ![Screenshot showing an example of a completed subpage](assets/images/subpage-complete.png)
   notice how you now have a dedicated page for your math class, and then at the top there is a navigation menu for you to see that it belongs to the school homepage.

    You can also see that on the left sidebar that the MATH 101 page does not appear, this is because it belongs to the School Homepage.

    ![screenshot showing the school homepage with the subpage in it](assets/images/school-homepage-after-subpage.png)
    when you go back to the school homepage it should look like this, with the MATH 101 subpage appearing as a link on the page.

You can repeat this for all of your classes, allowing you to have a subpage for everything, keeping all your notes and information nice and organized.
